            Hello! I'm a passionate developer with a deep interest in technology
            and all things related to computing. Over the years, I've dedicated
            myself to creating a variety of personal projects, driven by my
            passion for learning and exploring new technologies.

        <p class="text-pretty text-sm">
            I'm proficient in full-stack development and DevOps, with a
            particular focus on Vue.js and Nuxt for web development. On the
            DevOps side, I have experience with tools like GitHub Actions,
            Python, Automation, Linux, Terraform, and AWSâ€”skills I've been
            improving through both personal projects and professional
            experience.

        <p class="text-pretty text-sm">
            I hold a BUT in Computer Science from the University of Lyon 1 and
            am currently pursuing a three-year engineering degree at CPE Lyon,
            specializing in Computer Engineering. I completed an apprenticeship
            at Sanofi as a DevOps Developer during my final year of the BUT.
            Sanofi has continued to support me by hiring me as a DevOps Cloud
            Engineer throughout my engineering studies. This role is enhancing
            my skills in DevOps, particularly with GitHub Actions, Python,
            Terraform, and AWS. I also recently earned the GitHub Foundations
            certification, demonstrating my knowledge of GitHub.
